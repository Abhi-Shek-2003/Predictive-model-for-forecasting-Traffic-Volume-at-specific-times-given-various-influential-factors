# Predictive Model for Forecasting Traffic Volume

This repository contains the solution developed for **The Great Indian Hiring Hackathon**, organized by MachineHack. The challenge focuses on building a predictive model to forecast traffic volume at specific times using various influential factors.

## üìå Problem Statement

Participants are tasked with creating a predictive model that accurately forecasts traffic volume given specific times and influential factors such as weather, holidays, and contextual data provided in the dataset.

## üìÇ Dataset Overview

- **Train.csv**: Historical data containing traffic volume and associated influential factors.
- **Test.csv**: Dataset used for generating traffic volume predictions.
- **Sample_Submission_Format_expected.csv**: Specifies the format for submission.

### Key Features:
- **Time**: Timestamp indicating when the data was recorded.
- **Weather Conditions**: Factors such as temperature, precipitation, and cloud coverage.
- **Holiday Information**: Flags for holidays and their influence on traffic.
- **Contextual Factors**: Additional features affecting traffic flow.
- **many more**

## üîç Approach and Methodology

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyzed the distribution of traffic volume.
   - Investigated feature correlations to uncover key drivers of traffic.
   - Visualized patterns based on time, weather, and holiday data.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Extracted temporal features (e.g., hour of the day, day of the week).
   - Encoded categorical variables such as weather conditions and holidays.
   - Scaled numerical features for uniformity.

3. **Model Development**:
   - Experimented with multiple regression-based and tree-based algorithms.
   - Selected the best-performing model based on RMSE.
   - Tuned hyperparameters using grid search and cross-validation for improved accuracy.

4. **Prediction Generation**:
   - Applied the final model to the **Test.csv** data.
   - Generated traffic volume predictions.
